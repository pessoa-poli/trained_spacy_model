# About Resources:
Resources are any computational elements that can be used to retrieve information generated by an IoT device, or to deliver messages to an IoT device. Computational entities is a vague term. We therefore prefer to say that Resources are any means of storing IoT devices data, or delivering data to IoT devices. Moreover, sources of IoT devic's data that are not builtin an IoT device are also considered Resources, such as external databases.  
Given this, we can give some examples of Resources: IoT device's self storages such as RFID's data storages; Databases; Gateway data Caches;  
Also, some examples of means by which the data is retrieved or delivered, such as APIs, and Protocols are also resources.
Drivers are also resources, since they deliver information to an IoT device, it's usually specific information that regulates how the device is going to be operated, but nevertheless,  
Fiber Optics cables can be used to deliver and receive information, but they are not considered Resources, since they are not computational elements per se, even though data runs through them.

# About making phrases with more than one entity
The entities in this context are `device`, `resource` and `service`.
By using a `device` such as `Smart Thermostat` on can as `chatGPT` to generate phrases with a prompt such as:

> Please provide me 5 phrases with the words "Smart Thermostat" and "driver".  
> Format your answer so it looks like this example:  
> sentences = [  
> {"phrase":"phrase on about driver and Smart Thermostat", "entities":[("DEVICE",27,43),("RESOURCE",16,22)]},  
> {"phrase":"phrase on about driver and Smart Thermostat 2", "entities":[("DEVICE",27,43),("RESOURCE",16,22)]}  
> ]  

```python
# ANSWER:
sentences = [
{"phrase":"Installing the latest Smart Thermostat driver on your device will ensure compatibility with the latest models.", "entities":[("DEVICE",27,43),("RESOURCE",16,22)]},
{"phrase":"The Smart Thermostat driver allows you to control your thermostat from your smartphone or other connected device.", "entities":[("DEVICE",21,37),("RESOURCE",0,17)]},
{"phrase":"Updating the Smart Thermostat driver can improve performance and fix any issues you may be experiencing.", "entities":[("DEVICE",9,25),("RESOURCE",0,17)]},
{"phrase":"The Smart Thermostat driver integrates with other home automation systems, allowing for seamless control of all your connected devices.", "entities":[("DEVICE",4,20),("RESOURCE",0,17)]},
{"phrase":"By utilizing the Smart Thermostat driver, you can set customized schedules and temperature settings for optimal energy efficiency and cost savings.", "entities":[("DEVICE",20,36),("RESOURCE",3,19)]}
]
```

# About Services
Services can be identified by verbs that express IoT devices capabilities. It's my intuition that we can extract such examples where `services` appear in sentences by annotating previously generated phrases for the devices themselves.
Example:

```python
sentences=[
    {"phrase":"John appreciated how the Honeywell Home T9 Smart Thermostat provided him with detailed energy usage reports, helping him identify areas where he could save money.",
    "entities":[("DEVICE",25,59),("SERVICE",60,68)]}
    ]
```
In the phrase above, should we consider the word `identify` as a `service` ? It seems like we should not, since this action is not executed by the IoT device itself, but rather, by the owner of the device.
It might be the case that we could extract and annotate such cases using SPACY and some syntactic rules.
